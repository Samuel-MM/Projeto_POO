## Introduction
This is a simple object-oriented programming project that implements a brownie shop-themed CRUD.
It was developed to show all OOP concepts learned in C125-L1 classes.

## How it Works
This project allows you to create a product (brownie) and store it in a json file (database),
read and show a list with all of your products, update each parameter of your product and also delete it.
It uses a package called json-simple to interact with json file. You can learn a little more about it watching our
